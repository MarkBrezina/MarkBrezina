## Mark Brezina – Projects Overview

This GitHub contains work across two domains.

### 🔹 Data Analytics / BI / Engineering
Repositories focused on analytics, reporting, and data quality:
- repo_A – Power BI / KPI frameworks
- repo_B – SQL / ETL pipelines
- repo_C – Data validation & governance tools

### 🔹 Quant Research & Trading Systems
Core building blocks for systematic trading — research → portfolio construction → execution.

- **Foundational Quantitative Research** - *(Start here)*  
  Research notes and papers outlining a layered systematic trading framework (signals → portfolio construction → execution/risk), with extensions to market-making and broader financial primitives (insurance, banking).

- **Market States & Regimes** — *(market-states)* <a href="https://github.com/MarkBrezina/Market-States-Regimes">market states</a>
  HMM/HSMM-style regime labeling, change-point / structural-break detection, volatility clustering, transition probabilities, regime-conditioned features.

- **Alpha Research & Backtesting** — *(backtest-engine)*  
  Signal library + walk-forward validation, portfolio-level simulation, transaction cost + turnover constraints, performance attribution & experiment tracking.

- **Portfolio Construction & Risk** — *(portfolio-risk)*  
  Covariance/risk models (EWMA/shrinkage), vol targeting, factor exposures, VaR/CVaR, stress & scenario analysis, leverage/liquidity/concentration constraints.

- **Execution & Microstructure Simulation** — *(execution-sim)*  
  Slippage/spread/impact models, participation logic, order simulation, and robustness checks bridging research ↔ production.

Each repository is modular, documented, and includes reproducible examples (notebooks/scripts) plus tests.


### 🧪 Curiosity Lab (for fun)
Side experiments that sharpen my intuition for complex systems — physics, markets, and populations.

- **N-Body Astrophysics** — gravitational multi-body simulations (stability, orbits, emergent structure)
- **Particle Streams** — interacting particle flows; noise, clustering, boundary effects
- **Virtual Economies** — auction-house microstructure experiments in World of Warcraft and New World (liquidity, information asymmetry, price impact)
- **Population Dynamics** — agent-based models (wealth/skill/luck, resource constraints, epidemic SIR-style dynamics)
